/**

## The Decentology Multitenancy/Composable standard

## `RegistryInterface` contract interface

The interface that all multitenant contracts should conform to.
If a user wants to deploy a new multitenant contract, their contract would need
to implement the Tenant interface.

Their contract would have to follow all the rules and naming
that the interface specifies.

## `clientTenants` dictionary

A dictionary that maps the Address of a client to the amount of Tenants it has
created through calling `instance`.

## `Tenant` resource

The core resource type that represents an Tenant in the smart contract.

## `instance` function

A function that all clients can call to receive an Tenant resource. The client
passes in their Address so clientTenants can get updated.

## `getTenants` function

A function that returns clientTenants.
